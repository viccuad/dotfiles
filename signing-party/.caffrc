Hi,

please find attached the user id{(scalar @uids >= 2 ? 's' : '')}
{foreach $uid (@uids) {
    $OUT .= "\t".$uid."\n";
};}of your key {$key} signed by me.

Note that I did not upload your key to any keyservers.
If you have multiple user ids, I sent the signature for each user id
separately to that user id's associated email address. You can import
the signatures by running each through `gpg --import`.

If you want this new signature to be available to others, please upload
it yourself. With GnuPG this can be done using
	gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --send-key {$key}

If you have any questions, you should perhaps read:
https://wiki.debian.org/Keysigning
https://www.debian.org/events/keysigning.html

or don't hesitate to ask (as far as I can answer).

Regards,
{$owner}
EOM
