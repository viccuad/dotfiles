# BUILD_PATH
# Type: STRING
# By default the package is built in a path of the following format
# /build/packagename-XXXXXX/packagename-version/ where XXXXXX is a random
# ascii string. This option allows one to specify a custom path where the
# package is built inside the chroot. Notice that the sbuild user in the

# locations are subdirectories of /tmp or /build. The buildpath must be an
# empty directory because the last component of the path will be removed
# after the build is finished. If you are running multiple sbuild instances
# with the same build path in parallel for the same package, make sure that

# resolver uses aptitude to resolve build dependencies.  The aptitude
# resolver is similar to apt, but is useful in more complex situations,
# such as where multiple distributions are required, for example when
# building from experimental, where packages are needed from both unstable
# and experimental, but defaulting to unstable. If the dependency situation

# using all alternatives.  Note that this does not include
# architecture-specific alternatives, which are reduced to the build
# architecture prior to alternatives removal.  This should be left disabled
